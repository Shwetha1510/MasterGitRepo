Dear Sashi,
NITI Aayog is organizing MOVE: A Global Mobility Summit on September 7 and 8 in Delhi. It’s a 2 day global summit with active involvement of PM Modi, and invitations to many global CEOs, Government heads and city Mayors from around the world (refer to www.movesummit.in).
Leading up to this Summit is a Global Mobility Hackathon (For details, please refer www.movehack.gov.in).
The Hackathon platform has 10 problem statements and invites applications from around the world from teams to solve these problems across all modes – shipping, air, rail, buses, last mile connectivity – for both passenger and commercial goods. Datasets from Government organizations such as IRCTC, Delhi Metro, Delhi Public transport, etc have been released on the platform.
The application submission deadline is August 28. The final round will be held in Delhi on Sept 5 and 6. Final demonstrations and prize giving will be held in the presence of PM Modi on September 7 in Delhi.
NASSCOM is a strategic partner for the global hackathon (http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=181379). We are helping NITI Aayog with the planning, outreach, mentorship and jury.
This is a great opportunity for the industry to get involved and help find solutions for India. I encourage you and your teams to please get involved in one or more of the following ways:
•	Submit your applications – Anyone can apply, Corporates, SMEs, startups and Entrepreneurs. Rewards worth 2 crores are being given out, but more importantly for your companies, a chance to showcase a cutting edge solution on a National stage and implement the solution with a Government agency – please visit www.movehack.gov.in. Application deadline is Aug 28.
•	Host a facebook live session (one time 2 hour commitment), or become a mentor on the online platform (1 hour per day until Aug 28).
•	Become a jury member from Aug 29 to 31 to review applications (approx. 10 to 15 hours of work).
Please reply to this email with your positive reply. Look forward to your response and support.
