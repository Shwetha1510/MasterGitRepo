As you can see above, the git commit command has committed the changes in the four files in the local repository.

Now, if you want to commit a snapshot of all the changes in the working directory at once, you can use the command below:

git commit -a

I have created two more text files in my working directory viz. edureka5.txt and edureka6.txt but they are not added to the index yet. 

I am adding edureka5.txt using the command:

git add edureka5.txt

I have added edureka5.txt to the index explicitly but not edureka6.txt and made changes in the previous files. I want to commit all changes in the directory at once. Refer to the below snapshot.
