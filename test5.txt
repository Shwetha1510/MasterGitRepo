Previously (long time ago) I made a public repository on Github, with some files. Now I set up a local Git repository on my current computer, and committed some files. Then I added a remote pointing to my Github page:

[root@osboxes c]# git remote add learnc https://github.com/michaelklachko/Learning-C
That seemed to be successful:

[root@osboxes c]# git remote show learnc
* remote learnc
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/michaelklachko/Learning-C
  Push  URL: https://github.com/michaelklachko/Learning-C
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (local out of date)
Now I want to download the files from my Github repo to my computer. I did this:

[root@osboxes c]# git fetch learnc
[root@osboxes c]# git merge learnc/master
warning: refname 'learnc/master' is ambiguous.
Already up-to-date.
However, I don't see any new files in my local directory. How can I get them?

I also tried to do this:
